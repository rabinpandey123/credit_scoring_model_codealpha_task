📊 Credit Scoring Model
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Credit Scoring Model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. The model helps financial institutions assess creditworthiness and make informed lending decisions.

Two machine learning algorithms are used:

Logistic Regression (baseline model)

Random Forest Classifier (ensemble model for better performance)

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle
.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of raw credit data (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling).

Implementation of Logistic Regression for interpretability.

Implementation of Random Forest for improved accuracy and robustness.

Model evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualization of feature importance (Random Forest).
